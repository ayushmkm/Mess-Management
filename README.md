## Smart Mess Management System

A Java Swing + MySQL based desktop application designed to optimize and digitalize the mess management process in college hostels. The system enables students to view daily meal menus, book meal coupons in advance, and helps mess authorities accurately estimate the required food quantity significantly reducing food waste and improving efficiency.

## Key Features
Login Interface:
 Users can securely log in using their college ID and institutional email. Once verified, access is granted to their personalized dashboard based on their role (Student or Mess Admin).

Student Dashboard:
 Displays the daily and weekly meal menus (breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner). Students can book meal coupons for selected meals, download e-coupons, and track previous bookings.

Coupon Booking System:
 Allows students to pre-book meals within a specified time window. Each booking is stored in the database and automatically updates the estimated number of servings required for the day.

Mess Admin Panel:
Provides the mess management team with real-time data on total bookings per meal, enabling them to plan cooking quantities effectively and minimize food wastage. Admins can also update menus, view analytics, and manage user accounts.

Report & Notification Module:
Generates daily and weekly reports on total meals booked, unused coupons, and food waste trends. Optional notifications or reminders can be sent to students for meal booking deadlines.

Logout Option:
A secure logout feature ensures data privacy and prevents unauthorized access after use.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to streamline and automate the mess management process within educational institutions. It aims to promote sustainability by reducing food waste, enhance operational efficiency for mess staff, and provide convenience and transparency for students through digital meal booking and management.

By integrating real-time booking analytics and digital meal coupons, the system fosters a smarter, data-driven approach to campus dining operations.
